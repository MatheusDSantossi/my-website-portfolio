# My Portfolio Website

This was going to be my personal portfolio website built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. The website showcases projects, skills, and other relevant information. After some research, I decided to create three different projects, this one and the next one will be based on two different tutorials, after that I'll create my own website.
